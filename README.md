Announcement - Issues page merged with Turnitin's support page
================

In order to be able to better monitor incoming issues, we are consolidating the 3 issues pages for the 2 plagiarism plugins and Direct v2 with our existing support area.

The support area is how our team currently monitors issues for every other area of Turnitin. Therefore, we will be closing the Issues pages. If you have issues with Turnitin Direct v2, please raise them here: https://helpcenter.turnitin.com/hc/en-us/requests/new

The team appreciates your ongoing support and contributions. Thank you!

Moodle Direct v2
================

Please be aware that the **Develop** branch should not be considered production ready, although it contains the latest fixes and features it may contain bugs. It should be avoided in favour of the **Master** branch which is the latest available branch that has been through the QA process. Please make any pull requests you would like to make to the develop branch.
